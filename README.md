# ItemQualities

ItemQualities is a Minecraft Plugin for 1.18+ Servers that adds a special functionality to Damagable items.

Inspired by the [Quality Tools](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quality-tools) mod and the Item Quality
system in [Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/).

Each item, when crafted, picked up or looted will have a random Quality assigned to it.

The plugin is customizable, many configuration options and, most importantly, the ability to create your own qualities!
