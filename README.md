# ItemQualities
A plugin that adds Qualities to Items, along with the ability for the user to create their own.

Inspired by Item Qualities in Terraria.

These qualities will modify certain aspects of an items, such as;

It's durability loss, max durability and drops from using said item.

View the [Wiki](https://github.com/Steel-Dev/ItemQualities/wiki) for information on Examples and how to create your own Quality.

An example of a Horrible Quality Netherite Sword:

Future Plans:
-An alternative way of creating Qualities via commands or a gui. (maybe an external generator?)
-More values a Quality can modify on an item
